ANGIE DIAZ CPSC 1020 PROJECT 3: TIGERCARD GAME 

If you attempted to solve any of the extra credit challenges, please add this txt file to your submission.

Briefly comment on which challenge(s) you attempted to solve and how you solved them. 1-2 sentences per challenge is sufficient. We just need to know what to look out for.


1. The first challenge I attempted was to ask the user how many cards each player should draw to determine the rounds played.
I made a do-while loop that asked the user to enter how many cards they wanted and stored into a variable, which continued while the variable was less than 1 or greater than 15. 
Then I used that variable when creating my player object and as the condition in my for loop for the rounds. 


2. The second challenge I attempted was to ask the player if they would want to play again and then print a summary of all the games. 
I decided to create a struct called totalGames that represented each game and each round's points with two vectors inside, I also used a printFunction to print the entire summary of all games.
